			<h3 id="part1">What is League of Legends?</h3>
			<p>League of Legends is a competitive online game that combines RTS and RPG gameplay elements. 
				The objective is two teams face off in battlegrounds to achieve an objective such as destroying 
				the main base, getting the most points by destroying other players and getting objectives. Each 
				player chooses a champion (character) to play and works as a team to achieve objectives.</p>

			<p>The most popular game mode is 5v5 where players can level up by slaying minions and players 
				to level up and get gold to buy powerful items. It is currently one of the most competitive 
				game worldwide and is usually featured in esports. Click <a href="http://www.leagueoflegends.com">here</a>  
				for more information.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3 id="part2">Why the need for League of Legends API?</h3>
			<p>League of Legends is often seen among gamers a spot and there are competitions internationally 
				that are streamed on popular websites like <a href="http://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a>. With competitive 
				games like League of Legends, there is a need to access statistics to check out the popular players around 
				the globe. It would also be important to research statistics of champion win rates to see which champion to 
				play to increase the chances of winning or the item, rune, and mastery builds that the players pick.</p>
			<p>There are a lot of websites that uses League of Legends API to get database information such as:</p>

			<h3 id="part3">API Login</h3>
			<img src="pics/createAccount.jpg" alt="Create Account">
			<img src="pics/LoL_API_FrontPage.jpg" alt="API Front Page">
			<p>The League of Legends API provided by Riot Games requires the user to become familiar with JSON 
				and basic object-oriented knowledge. In order for you to access the API, you need a key provided 
				to you by Riot Games. In order to get the key, you require a league of legends account. click
				<a href="https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na">here</a>
				 to sign up for a new account. Once the new account has been made, click 
				 <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started">here</a> to log in and 
				gain access to the API key. </p>
			<p>Note that the user does not have to play the game in order to access the API.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3 id="part4">Accessing the API</h3>
			<p>All requests requires the API key to be appended into the URL at the end like below:</p>
			<div id="code"><p>https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/[region]/v1.4/summoner/by-name/[SummonerName]?api_key=[API_key]</p></div>
			<p>If the API key is not included in the url, the server will return an error message and explain the reason.</p>
			<div id="code"><p>{"status": {"message": "Missing api key", "status_code": 401}}</p></div>			
			<p>Basically, once you have the API key for League of Legends, you can proceed in using the URL in a cURL or 
				get/post request to access the data (using JSON_decode() for example). By using the link above and filling 
				in the squared brackets, the user can access information about the player based on the region and the 
				summoner(player) name. This will open up to other information such as game statistics on champions used, 
				win rate, rune pages, games played, etc.</p>
			<p>Even though this is considered a free API to use as long as the person has a user account, there is an 
				limit to how many people can access the API as shown below:</p>
			<img src="pics/rateLimit.jpg" alt="Rate Limit">
			<p>Note that it is highly recommended to use a post request or another method to hide the API key on the URL. 
				If users have access to the API key, they can abuse the API key and cause the person accessing the API 
				even more limited access due to it being more likely that the user will reach the rate limit.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3 id="part5">League of Legends Full Reference Page</h3>
			<img src="pics/LoL_API_Reference.jpg" alt="API Reference Page">
			<p>The LoL Full API Reference page provides the user what information to pull by major category. The user can
				pull champion information, match history, general statistics, player information, ect.</p>			
			<img src="pics/API_Request_Results.jpg" alt="API Request Results">
			<p>When one of the major categories is clicked from the reference page, it will drop down the link example as well
			as what information can be pulled from the API request. In the case above with the link, the curly brackets ({}) 
			indicates that the user has to enter the information. Note that all API requests begins with the link 
			"https://na.api.pvp.net". Lets analyze the link below to breakdown the URL contents:</p>
			<div id="code"><p>https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/{region}/v1.4/summoner/by-name/{summonerName}</p></div>
			<ul>
				<li>{region} is the region that you want the information pulled from such as "na" for North America or "kr" for
				South Korea.</li>
				<li>v1.4 is the version that API database. This is something that the user has to update the correct version number
				if the information does not show up.</li>
				<li>The {summonerName} is the name of the player on League of Legends that you are trying to look for.</li>
				<li>The way to use the API is to see which category the user wants to pull information from to build the get
				request information. Generally the curly braces ({}) is what the user has to fill in the get or post request.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> As seen in the picture above, the user also has the option to pull a get request directly from the API reference
				page by filling in the "Path Parameters" and clicking on the "Execute Request" button. This will generate the
				the request URL and the breakdown shown below:</p>
			<img src="pics/API_Breakdown.jpg" alt="API Breakdown">
			<p>If you put the request URL onto your search engine, you will see the result as in a JSON format. To pull the
				information, the user would have to use JSON_decode() to pull the information and manipulate it afterwards. If
				the user wants to search for the summoner name "MrDespair" in the NA server, they would fill in the information
				above and it will return: </p>
			<div id="code"><p>{"mrdespair":{"id":103470,"name":"MrDespair","profileIconId":582,"summonerLevel":30,"revisionDate":1424918097000}}</p></div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3 id="part6">Response Errors</h3>
			<img src="pics/responseError.jpg" alt="Response Errors">
			<p>There are many response codes that the server sends back to the user. General if the response code is 200, then
				it indicates that there are no errors. Listed above are some of the common error codes that the League of Legends 
				API returns to the user. Generally if the user is returned a status code of 400, it tells the user that it is a
				bad request, meaning that the user or the programmer did not enter the correct data to send to the API server. If
				the server returns a status code of 401, it usually means that the user did not enter the the correct API key or
				that none was provided in the get request URL. The other errors can occur as well if you either exceed the rate
				limit or if the servers are down (which happens often due to how big the game is and how often they get DDOS attacks).
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3 id="part7">Example: Looking for runes information of a player</h3>
			<p>In this example, we will be looking for what runes the player "MrDespair" has in the North
				American server. Lets see what the requirements are to look up runesinformation...</p>
			<img src="pics/summonerSearch.jpg" alt="Summoner Search">
			<p>As we can see in the picture above, in order to access the runes information, we need the region
			and the summoner ID number. We already know that player is from NA so na will be filled out for {region}. Because
			the only other information that we need is summer ID number, this can be found by performing a get request using 
			the player name to get the ID. In this case, we will request the information using the URL below:
			<div id="code"><p>https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/by-name/mrdespair?api_key={Enter API Key Here}</p></div>
			<p>Once the search has been completed, it will return the JSON information below:
			<div id="code"><p>{"mrdespair":{"id":103470,"name":"MrDespair","profileIconId":582,"summonerLevel":30,"revisionDate":1424918097000}}</p></div>
			<p>Now we know that the player ID number is 103470.</p>
			<p>Next, we will be searching for what rune page the player has by searching through the code below and it will return what rune pages 
				the player has. The result returns a very large amount of data so only a portion of the code will be shown.</p>
			<div id="code"><p>https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.4/summoner/103470/runes?api_key={Enter API Key Here}</p></div>
			<img src="pics/runes.jpg" alt="Rune Page Search Result.">
			<img src="pics/runeDescription.jpg" alt="Rune Page ID">
			<p>Now that we have the rune information, the only thing we need to do now is extract the information. The rune positions 
				ID numbers are used from loldevelopers.de.vu to shorten the search process. If we compare the data, the runeID is the
				type of rune and the runeSlotID is the slot number the rune is in.</p>
			<p>Now that we learned about creating an account to get the API key, how to search for information using the reference page, and
				an example, you are now ready to try this out yourself!</p>
